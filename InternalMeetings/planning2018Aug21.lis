IoT Meetup brainstorming session 21Aug2018
------------------------------------------

 I. Discussions
   1. Meetup should have some structure, as oppose to an amorphous hangout session

   2. First consideration is topic based meetup, where the first section is
      one or more speakers addressing the topic, followed up by Q&A
      and small breakout discussions.

   3. Another possible structure is: main speaker(s) => show & tell => breakout discussions.

   4. Initial target is once per month, with planning done 1 month ahead of the meetup.
  
   5. Proposal to have sessions on IoT fundamentals was shot down, for now. Main reason
      was the low value of such a session, and the potential lack of interest from
      more skilled attendees.

   6. Basic skill level for attendees should be working familiarity with HW/SW. Preferred
      skills are at industry level software and hardware engineers.

   7. There is some contention as to how much company marketing is allowed -- opinions
      range from none to some to any. Minimum is to be topic and project based, preferrably
      personal projects based on their company's products.


II. Action Items

   1. Done. Create slack channel for internal discussions.
      larry - created channel iotmeetup.

   2. Done. Create repo for meetup artifacts accessible to public.
      gil - created repo at https://github.com/fatcatfablab/IoTmeetup

   3. Open. Break up effort into smaller tasks and distribute among coordinators.
